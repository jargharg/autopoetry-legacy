# autopoetry
Inspired by the cut-up technique of William S Burroughs, this app searches for your phrase in the <a href="http://open-platform.theguardian.com/" target="_blank">Guardian API</a> and slices up an article to make a poem with random snippets.

Object-oriented Javascript (ES6, Webpack, Babel, Gulp), HTML5 and PostCSS.
